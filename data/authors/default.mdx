## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm David Galiata

I am passionate about the **IT industry, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.** 

My technical background is in server infrastructure (Windows & Linux), networking, firewalls/security, storage, virtualization, and recently cloud services. I apply these skills at my current role as a Security Architect for Aquia.

In addition to my technical interests, I enjoy spending time with my family, coaching soccer, playing chess, and reading.

#### A brief timeline of my career:

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe writing and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a IT professional.
