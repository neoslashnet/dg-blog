Today I worked on spinning up a new SQL server RDS instance and received an error while launching the instance.   

**_Error: The specified VPC does not support DNS resolution, DNS hostnames, or both._**

Turns out the VPC I created did not have DNS Resolution or Hostnames enabled.

_To correct this you need to log into the [AWS VPC Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/  )  
  
**Right click** on the **VPC and Edit the two DNS options- set to Yes**.
