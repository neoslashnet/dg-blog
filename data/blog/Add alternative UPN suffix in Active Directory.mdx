I'm currently working on converting "In cloud" Office 365 accounts to Active Directory synced accounts. As a step in the process, I had to match the UPN suffix to match the "Username" or SMTP Value in Office 365.  

  
Open the **Active Directory Domains and Trusts snap-in**.  

In the left pane, **right-click Active Directory Domains and Trusts** and select **Properties**.

**Under Alternate UPN suffixes, type the name of the suffix you want to add**.

Click Add and **OK**.
