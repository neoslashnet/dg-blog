Throughout this week I've been working with a customer on an issue where we've been looking at Geo Blocking. I decided to perform a quick test on a FortiGate firewall and was surprised just how easy it was. I'm going to look at implementing this into my normal configs going forward. 

### Create objects

The first step is to create an address objects for the countries you want to block.

**Go to Policy&Object -> addresses
Then select 'create' and 'new address'**

**Name: Choose a name
Type: Select 'Geography'
Country: Select the country to block**

Again, do this for all the countries to block.

Then, create a group for these countries that needs to be blocked.

Select 'create' and 'new address group'

### Configure Policies

The last thing to do is to create a policy.
Go to Policy & Object -> IPv4 Policy

Below is a sample of the policy. It is essentially inside to outside- Deny to the Geo-Block address group.

Do the same but in reverse for traffic where the source is outside destined for you network. 

### Test the policies

Enable the policies when ready and perform testing. This is a sample test I performed. As you can see it worked!

You can also check the policy to look at how much traffic has been sent.

I hope this helps!
