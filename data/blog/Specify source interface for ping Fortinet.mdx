Yesterday I was doing some troubleshooting and testing on an SD-WAN implementation and found that the ping command in Fortios is a little different than others. I did a packet capture and so no packets flowing on WAN2 and I wanted to check if the connection was up. So I went to the CLI!

From the CLI Console execute the following command to check the current settings. 

``` 
execute ping-options view
```

This displays the current interface.  Per the example below, it has “Auto” as the Source Address.

Ping Options:

        Repeat Count: 5

        Data Size: 56

        Timeout: 2

        Interval: 1

        TTL: 64

        TOS: 0

        DF bit: unset

        Source Address: auto

        Pattern:

        Pattern Size in Bytes: 0

        Validate Reply: no

In my scenario, I needed to send a ping out of the WAN2  interface, where  2.2.2.2 is the IP address. The command below sets the IP of WAN2 as the source. 

```
execute ping-options source 2.2.2.2
``` 
After that the final step is to ping your destination. 

```
exec ping 8.8.8.8
```
