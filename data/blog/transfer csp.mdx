I took over a client that utilizes Office 365. Their former MSP is a Microsoft CSP. Being that my consulting firm doesn't resell Microsoft products I was tasked with transferring their account and licenses.  
  
I did a little research and found the solution is quite simple but not well documented. I thought I'd share this in a blog post to save someone the hassle.  
  
I found all you need to do is purchase the same amount of licenses currently in use (Monthly or Annual) under the subscriptions in the Office 365 Admin Portal. Then when the CSP pulls their subscription, all the licenses will be accounted for. You don't need to inventory or manually apply the licenses for each account.  
  
Pretty simple right? Hope this saves someone time and ensures you do not disrupt Office 365 services.jive_content_id_USA)
