Encountered a Unifi controller that would not load the web interface. I discovered that the drive was full and had to be expanded.  
  
In order to expand a volume in AWS I had to go through the standard process of - Creating a snapshot, create a volume from a snapshot, shut the instance down, detach, attach (New volume), and boot the instance back up again.   
  
The instance booted back up and checking df -h everything looked good! The only issue is while looking at the logs I found the following error- **DbServer not shutdown cleanly and need repairing on next startup.** Performing a clean reboot did not resolve the issue.  
  
I was able to find the correct process of repairing the database for Debian Linux.  
  
``` 
service unifi stop  
  
mongod --dbpath /usr/lib/unifi/data/db --smallfiles --logpath /usr/lib/unifi/logs/server.log --repair  
  
service unifi start  
```
