Last week I had to "Break" a stack where there were four switches and I needed to use one outside in an IDF.  
  
Executing the **show run** command showed there were indeed 4 switches in the stack-  
  
switch 1 provision ws-c3750x-48p  
switch 2 provision ws-c3750x-48p  
switch 3 provision ws-c3750x-48p  
switch 4 provision ws-c3750x-48p  
  
In order to  remove switch 4 I had to run the following command (In configuration mode)-  

```
no switch 4 provision ws-c3750x-48p 
```  

**wr mem**

After that- Power down the stack, remove the necessary cables, and re-cable the stack. Upon rebooting the switches you should no longer see the switch which has been removed.
