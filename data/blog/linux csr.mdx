Today I had to install a new SSL certiciate on a Linux web server running NGINX. Below are the steps needed-  
  
**(As root) cd /etc/ssl/private**

```
openssl genrsa -out myprivatekey.key 2048  
  
openssl req -new -key myprivatekey.key -out CSR.txt
```  
  
From there you can copy the txt file to another directory and use Winscp to transfer it to your local device. The method I used is **cat CSR.txt** and I copied the CSR request details directly within the terminal.
