Earlier today I made a simple change to a freeradius server at one of my clients. After making this change, I attempted to restart the service. I received the following error-


```
root@ucs:~# systemctl restart freeradius
Job for freeradius.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status freeradius.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
``` 

This created an issue for me as this radius server handles the authentication for a VPN with MFA. 

Based on the error message, I ran the following command-


```
journalctl -xe

``` 
Which showed me the following output-


```
/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-config/files/authorize[222]: Parse error (check) for entry myusername: Expected end of line or comma
``` 

One of the changes I made was a password change for myusername. After checking the error message, I realized you cannot have the * symbol as the last character in the password. This throws off freeradius and will not allow the service to start. After adjusting this I was able to start the service and keep the login's working
