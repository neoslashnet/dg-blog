I performed troubleshooting today and created the PowerShell script below to map two drives and label the volumes. By default the label was the share name of the folder. I needed to change it to something more user friendly.  
  
Here is the script-  

```
$Net = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Network   
$Rename = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application   
  
\#### # Map the network drives   
$Net.MapNetworkDrive("Q:", '\\\\hostname\\shared\_data01')   
$Net.MapNetworkDrive("R:", '\\\\hostname\\share\_data02')  
  
\#### # Rename everything   
$rename.NameSpace("Q:\\").Self.Name = 'Network -> Share Data01'   
$rename.NameSpace("R:\\").Self.Name = 'Network -> Share Data02'
```
