The last couple months I've been working with Citrix VDA and RDS servers. I've had to install office via Click to Run. The overall process is pretty straight forward but I did run into a little bit of a snag on confirming the exact Product ID I needed for my installation. The link below has the exact Product ID's for each version you may need. 

## The install process

The first step is to create a directory on the system/server. I normally create a folder called c:\support\365

Next you'll need to download the  [Office Deployment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117) extract the files to the folder you recently created- c:\support\365

Then open a command prompt window, change into the c:\support\365 directory and execute the following command- 


```
setup.exe /download
``` 
This will download the Office software to the folder. 

After this is complete, you can install by executing the following command which uses a configuration file- configuration.xml. I included a sample of the one I've been using for reference. 


```
setup.exe /configure configuration.xml
``` 

Executing this command will begin the Office installation process. 

**Sample of my configuration.xml file-**


```
<!-- Office 365 client configuration file sample. To be used for Office 365 ProPlus apps, 
     Office 365 Business apps, Project Pro for Office 365 and Visio Pro for Office 365. 

     For detailed information regarding configuration options visit: http://aka.ms/ODT. 
     To use the configuration file be sure to remove the comments

     The following sample allows you to download and install the 64 bit version of the Office 365 ProPlus apps 
     and Visio Pro for Office 365 directly from the Office CDN using the Monthly Channel
     settings  -->

<Configuration>

  <Add OfficeClientEdition="64" Channel="Monthly">
    <Product ID="O365BusinessRetail">
      <Language ID="en-us" />
    </Product>
    </Add>

  <!--  <Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Monthly" /> -->

  <!--  <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />  -->

  <!--  <Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" />  -->

</Configuration>

``` 

Here is a list of all the  [Product ID's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/troubleshoot/installation/product-ids-supported-office-deployment-click-to-run) for Office products that are compatible with the Office Deployment tool..
