Recently I set up a freeradius server to work with DUO MFA for a remote access VPN. Everything worked but I had to reboot the server and I noticed the freeradius server service was not running after the reboot.  
  
Please note you can replace the freeradius service with the name of the service in which you are working with.  
  
To enable the service to automatically start I ran the following command-  

```
systemctl enable freeradius.service
```
  
  
To disable a service from automatically starting you can run the following command  

```
systemctl unmask freeradius.service
```
