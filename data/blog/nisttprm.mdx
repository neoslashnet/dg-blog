# Introduction
I've been doing a lot of reading of The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. It is designed to help organizations of all sizes and sectors (Not just government!) protect their assets, data, and networks from cyber threats.

Integrating the NIST CSF into your third party risk management (TPRM) process can help you identify and mitigate the risks associated with working with external vendors and partners. In this blog post I'll lay out how you can get started. 

# Assess your current TPRM process: 
Take a look at your current TPRM process and determine what, if any, elements of the NIST CSF are already being addressed. This will give you a good starting point for integrating the framework.

# Identify your critical assets and data: 
The NIST CSF is built around the concept of protecting critical assets and data. Identify the assets and data that are most important to your organization and consider how they could be impacted by a cyber threat.

# Evaluate third party risks: 
Use the NIST CSF to evaluate the risks associated with each of your third party vendors and partners. This includes both technical risks (such as vulnerabilities in their systems) and non-technical risks (such as their policies and procedures for managing cybersecurity).

# Develop a plan for managing third party risks: 
Based on your risk assessment, develop a plan for managing the risks associated with your third party vendors and partners. This might include implementing additional security measures, requiring vendors to meet certain cybersecurity standards, or establishing contingency plans in the event of a cyber incident.

# Implement and monitor the plan: 
Once you have a plan in place, implement it and monitor your third party vendors and partners to ensure that they are meeting the requirements outlined in the plan. Regularly review and update the plan as needed to ensure that it continues to effectively address your organization's third party risks.

# Conclusion
Integrating the NIST CSF into your TPRM process can help you identify and mitigate the risks associated with working with external vendors and partners. By taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity, you can protect your organization's critical assets and data from cyber threats.
