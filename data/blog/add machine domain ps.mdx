I've been really trying to learn more PowerShell and use it more frequently.  I recently decided to script adding a server to a domain via PowerShell.  
  
Here is the command-  

```  
add-computer –domainname ad.contoso.com -Credential AD\\adminuser -restart –force  
```
  
Once entered you will be prompted to enter admin credentials.
