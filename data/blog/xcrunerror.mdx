summary: macOS xcrun error
---
I recently upgraded my OS and ran into this error when I tried any git operation on my macbook. 

```js
$ git pull
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools),
missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
``` 
After doing some research, I found the fix is pretty straight forward. Install the Xcode toolkit! Even if you had it installed before, you might have to re-register it or update it to the latest version.

```js
$ xcode-select --install
``` 
If that doesn’t work, force it to reset. You’ll need sudo access for this one.

```js
$ sudo xcode-select --reset
``` 
If that fails, go to the Apple[developer download section](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)and download Xcode manually.
