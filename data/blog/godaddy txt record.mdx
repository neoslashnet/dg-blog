Domain verification has become something every one has to do in order to use certain services. For example, Microsoft 365. I ran into a little snag today and it wasn't as straightforward as I thought. 

My customer already had and txt record in Route 53 for their spf. I had a request to add another txt record for another service to perform domain ownership/verification. 

When I went to add the record, it would not allow me to use @ as the host as it created a new rcord @.domain.com instead of using the root level domain name.

After researching this, I found the answer is to add the txt value into the already existing record in quotes underneath the existing value. 

This is an example:

```
"ms=M23445345"
"v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all"
``` 
The interesting part is when I did a dig and nslookup for txt records, the results show two different txt records.
